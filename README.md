# bulgarian-media-freedom

Browser extension that notifies Bulgarian media readers of sponsorships

### Why

In Bulgaria we have a serious problem with [Press
Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index). We're
ranked #111 for a few consecutive years now.

Wise Bulgarian folklore says "Който плаща, той поръчва музиката" –
"What music is played is ordered by the one who pays".

So let's see who sponsors who.

### Database

This add-on's database of media sponsorship programs is still quite
limited.  Please open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ydm/bulgarian-media-freedom/issues) if you
can help expanding it.

Big thanks to America for Bulgaria Foundation for being open about
their sponsorship programs.  Hopefully everybody will eventually
follow their example.
